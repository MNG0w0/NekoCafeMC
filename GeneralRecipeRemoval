// This is meant to be a general way to remove recipes without making a new script for each and every one

// Use this as a template to remove
    // craftingTable.removeRecipe(<item:>);
    // note: if your code is not working, check your fucking ;s 

// Mob imprisonment Tool Removal
   craftingTable.removeRecipe(<item:industrialforegoing:mob_imprisonment_tool>);
